Requirements:
- jupyenv
- datascience cookie cutter format
- command to export notebook into html or pdf
- Data exploration tools:
	- Quick plotting and exploration tools without code
		- Plotly explore I believe
		- geoviews tool as well
	- color pallette packages and good color palette default
	- Set up Gill Sans as the default matplotlib font
	- environment variables setup with .env.local for when it's needed
- Effective and simple to use solution for caching specifically .read_file funciton calls which can be long for large files. That's deliberate caching on a function level with a decorator or something. Moreover, it would be nice to have cell caching if input variables have not changed. Basically, I try to make my cells pure functions. It's not that straightforward, but let's research this.
	- Look into xetcache
	
- Linting rules for notebook:
	- No unused imports
	- no unused variables
	- Type stuff for python
	- Variable scope
	- Variable is used before initialization
	- Better defaults for VSCode notebook UI settings
- Auto-formatting of notebook on save
	- remove unused imports
